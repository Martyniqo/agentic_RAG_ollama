Best Options?', description=\"Had a very shitty 30s, undiagnosed chronic health issues and crappy jobs, fell into debt poor credit etc.\\n\\n2 years ago dug myself out of a shitty situation, got a stable job, paid off all my debts student loans etc and am now age 40, single, no partner, with a net worth of quite literally zero.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n* 40 year old guy\\n* Single no partner\\n* Currently renting a cramped 1bed flat just outside London.\\n* Net pay £3400\\n* Disposable income after essentials + food: £2000\\n* Excellent credit rating with zero blips in the past 6 years.\\n\\nFeels like I'm where I expected I would be at age 30, but it is what it is.\\n\\nWhat are the options for someone who potentially will want to have a family (just one kid) within the next 3-5 years?\\n\\nIdeally I'd want to be able to buy a decent place i could raise a family in since I'm at the stage where if I don't have a family soon it will become unrealistic. Which would be a 3bedroom place, but that's just impossible where i live with prices of £325K+.\\n\\nWhat options do I have, I've thought of:\\n\\n1. Buying a 1bed flat for about £150-200K next year and then maybe if ready for a family in the next few years sell and buy a proper home together. (problem is 1bed flats are really cramped esp as I work from home)\\n2. Stretch and buy a small 2 bed flat where I live for about £250K, or move a little further from london and get a bigger 2 bed flat for the same price, that can at least initially raise a child in, with a view to then sell it and buy proper home later on.\\n3. Move to somewhere really remote and cheap and buy a 3 bed detached. But lose all ties with friends and family. But at least have the option to move back if I can buy a home together with someone.\\n\\nAny other options I haven't thought of? Any advise?\\n\\n**EDIT**\\n\\n**Thanks a lot for the advise so far, I will read through it all in closer detail later when I get the time after work, but great stuff there. The main gist of which seems to be to do is just save/invest as much as I can over the next year and revisit it when I'm in a more immediate position to buy and have £20K savings in the bank.**\\n\\n  \\n**EDIT #2:**\\n\\n**Had a read through all the comments and I greatly appreciate the kind words from everyone. Even if I didn't respond I definitely appreciate the time and effort on offering advice, they were all useful and thought provoking.**\\n\\n**I've decided best thing to do is focus on just saving as much as I can  with an aim to make a decision further in the future (1-2 years from now) and just put up with this relatively crappy but low rent place i'm in at the moment.**\", comments=[\"shy_147 (upvotes: 53): Firstly, well done getting to a stable position you are in now, don't knock it, you have turned a bad situation around and taken responsbility for your debts.\\n\\nMy recomendation would be to relocate unless you have a specific need to stay in London. You work remotely, you can literally work anywhere in the UK that can give you a stable broadband connection, hell, you could even live out of a van conversion. Relocate to somewhere that you get more for your money and start saving aggresively for a deposit on a house. Again, straying into general life/financial advise, do you currently have a workplace or private pension? What does yout state pension payments look like currently? Where is this 2k disposable income going? I would also post this in UKFinance for more general financial advice/information.\", \"itallstartedwithapub (upvotes: 27): Debt-free is a good starting block. \\n\\nNext you'll need to focus on increasing your savings if you want to buy somewhere. You'll need a minimum of 5% deposit, plus around £3k to cover the costs of buying. For your £200k flat that would be £13k, for your £250k flat it's £16k.\\n\\nIf you're able to save £2k a month, you'll be there within a year. Saving every penny is probably not realistic though, so let's say £1k and 1.5 years. If you save more, great, you'll have more swing room.\\n\\nFrom the way you described your situation, I'd be very wary about cutting ties with friends and family by moving far away. A good support network is important, particularly when going through major changes in life like buying your first property.\\n\\nIt sounds like the 2 bed place would be ideal. Your salary I guess is around £55k, which would see you obtaining a mortgage of up to £250k.\", 'ProfessionalLie6370 (upvotes: 32): You have no money I would worry about that first before thinking about the problem of buying somewhere', \"gemstarsuk (upvotes: 23): I think this is less of a housing question and more of a life question. \\n\\nI'm presuming you'll be looking for a partner to have a child with? If so they may already have a suitable housing situation that you may be able to slot into so personally I'd suggest you keep renting in the short term to retain your flexibility.\"]),\n",

Check things like ground rent if it exists and admin charges. Insurance charges are also pretty hefty now.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeasehold is a con for many people, unfortunately.', 'theDoodoo22 (upvotes: 52): Lots of replies on here but most of which are very reactive without understanding the issue at all. From the information you have shared it’s impossible for anyone to have a conclusion so ignore most. \\n\\nYour either suddenly being ripped off out of the blue by a management company (in which case get the costs and contest them) or there has been a load of works needing to be done which should improve your property in which case look at those and share in here what they are. \\n\\nNine times out of ten it’s a major works that they are doing that needs paid off over a year. If you had a house and your roof went and you paid £10k or drainage was blocked up by trees costing you £7k it’s a similar scenario. \\n\\nFirst job is not to assume that a management company is nefarious, often it’s fairly young staff or unskilled staff managing costs. Secondly don’t panic, there is generally a route through. \\n\\nDo these steps:\\n\\n1) get a full breakdown of costs for this year, and look at the one you got last year and find what has changed, call the property management if you can’t find it, \\n2) if any costs are over what they should be you are legally protected to dispute these, start by understanding costs and asking them to get alternatives etc, \\n3) Go and make a Facebook group, or whatsapp group for owners of your property. Put posters in lifts and around property everyday and make a group (if there isn’t one already). Schedule a zoom to discuss,\\n4) if costs can’t be resolved you can either dispute legally under Landlord and Tenant act (it’s not rented but this covers leasehold) or you can simply vote the management company out. \\n\\nGetting a group of you together can really help as the management company will have a body/lobby which can sack them if they are not performing. \\n\\nTo be frank, in any leasehold flats I buy I would generally gather the information of other owners like this over time in case there is any costs in future. \\n\\nIf you are really stressing and it’s going to financially challenge you but have all paperwork I’m happy to have a look at it and tell you how I would do it.

From saying I've got the old Reddit carbonmonoxide  leak to being mad and alcoholic.  If my point was lost on people, sorry for my lack of being able to articulate quite how astnoshingly brilliant it was/is to let go of the 'family home' in my 50s and move on to a different location and live and work before I'm not able to, and encouraging people to not hang on there, when life could be so much better.\\n\\n  \\nI joined this sub back in the day because of my work and because of my kids renting and because I'm genuinely concerned about the housing stock in this country, everything from there isn't enough of it, the corruption in the rental market, the lack of skill in trades, and the lack of traiing opportunities in house building, and then the corruption in the house-building sector (as now proved through the CMA stuff back in the day) but mostly the horror that it is to even move out of a family home if you are a young person experiencing domestic issues and where do you go? (Call Centrepoint if you need help if you are a young person experiencing domestic abuse from within your family BEFORE you leave and they will help you: [https://centrepoint.org.uk/do-you-need-help/i-need-help-now/speak-someone](https://centrepoint.org.uk/do-you-need-help/i-need-help-now/speak-someone)\\n\\nI've had a lot of really nice feedback from people who get my point.

I'm mid-50s, had kids in at 30 and 33.  Husband died.  Kids off to uni.  One done, the other in his second year - factoring in gap years - and I just thought 'I can't wait for kid 2 to finish up'.\\n\\nSo I downsized.  From a three bed, three storey wonky terrace in a city on the South Coast near nice schools and so on - having lived there for over 20 years, and in the city itself for 30, via a rented flat and a bought flat previously - to a four-bed bungalow up north in a beautiful historic city.  And have no mortgage to pay now and cash in the bank for the kids to draw on when they need it.\\n\\nBUT.  Driving around today, I realised I got a really 'nice' 1950s bungalow, not on an estate, beautifully refurbished, probably paid more than £50,000 for that 'non-estate' bungalow feel alone, and the modernisation.  But if you are going to, this is such a rare find and you will be needing to upgrade anything you buy probably so do it now while you can.\\n\\nObviously not everyone wants to life-proof their future like I wanted to NOW - watching my husband become less and less able to handle stairs and generally 'do' 'old age' in his 40s and 50s probably colours my perspective, but I'm so glad I did it.\\n\\nThe other thing is - just looking at doing a last heft to sort out and get rid of half a tonne of crap I still managed to bring with me, despite having done six months of decluttering and tip runs before we moved - and thought I needed/wanted - I would not want to do this getting rid and decluttering and so on, let alone packing up, organising all of this move, dealing with the six months of hell that is buying and selling at any age, older than I am now, when I can still reach my toes and heft a box of shit.\\n\\nSo if this chimes with you, write off 2025 and start planning to downsize now before you can't, before the nice bungalows in nice places get priced out of your reach, be prepared to re-locate - I can work anywhere so there is that in my favour that might not be in yours - and get on the case.\\n\\nGood luck if you choose to - selling\\\\* a house you've considered your 'family home' is horrid and generally buying and selling is horrific - but your future self will thank your now self.\\n\\nEdit: Adding to this, I think the old-school thinking is you wait to retire before you downsize or move from the family home to a sad place.  I'm still going to be working for a good decade or more, mostly because I love what I do, and now that money goes into the bank, without debt and so on for it to be spent on, and hopefully I survive that long, and then I'm sorted into my dottage, having been 'here' and become part of the community while I'm still a functional human being!  And we free up the houses near the schools and rail stations and so on that appealed to us back in the day ...\\n\\nEdit 2: The bollocks people are saying here makes me realise that wise advice is not welcome.

      "Title: Rental advice - landlord deceived us and selling property\n",
      "Description: So I signed a 12 month lease on property in late Sept that is in a great location in London and was delighted to move in a great area. After two weeks of being in the flat the agency emailed us to say that the landlord was putting the property up for sale and was it okay for us to allow viewings. Naturally we were raging and called the agency who said the landlord had quite a high asking price so it should take a while for it to be sold - we managed to get it in writing that we will have 6 months in the property but I now found the flat on Rightmove and has been up since July so they knew that it was on the market while having us sign the lease. I know renters don't have many rights when it comes to landlord selling but this just seems way to fishy and they deceived us into signing a 12 month lease. Surely this should be illegal but do we have any rights to fight against this or what's the best option to get us to stay for the 12 months?\n",

      "OrdinaryAncient3573 (upvotes: 53): You can't be evicted during the fixed term. It is also going to be basically impossible for the landlord to sell the place without your goodwill. If you don't permit viewings and surveyor visits and so-on, it isn't going to sell.\n",
      "Johnny_Vernacular (upvotes: 26): If the landlord wants you out offer him 'cash for keys', basically they can buy you out of your contract. An empty flat is going to be worth tens of thousands more than one with sitting tenants on a twelve month contract. You're in a strong position, negotiate with him.\n",
      "Cauleefouler (upvotes: 22): Another example of an idiot landlord. Seemingly desperate to sell but allowed a 12 month tenancy agreement to be signed.

From a three bed, three storey wonky terrace in a city on the South Coast near nice schools and so on - having lived there for over 20 years, and in the city itself for 30, via a rented flat and a bought flat previously - to a four-bed bungalow up north in a beautiful historic city.

Driving around today, I realised I got a really 'nice' 1950s bungalow, not on an estate, beautifully refurbished, probably paid more than £50,000 for that 'non-estate' bungalow feel alone, and the modernisation.

I'm still going to be working for a good decade or more, mostly because I love what I do, and now that money goes into the bank, without debt and so on for it to be spent on, and hopefully I survive that long, and then I'm sorted into my dottage, having been 'here' and become part of the community while I'm still a functional human being!

He replied, \"I always tell people either do it **all** of it or do **none** of it.\" Which makes sense - why put money into a property you're about to sell if it won't raise the sale price by more than you put in? Especially given all the extra time / effort?\n",
      "\n",
      "But my question is: do people here agree with that \"do it all or do nothing\" statement? For example, my place has a degraded flat roof that's no longer water tight, that will cost something like £3-5K to repair (plus necessary drainage repairs at the same time). It looks awful. Is there any argument for getting that done before the sale? Or given the place is still a doer-upper and most likely to be bought by a builder/renovator, would fixing the flat roof be a waste of time/money? Is that true of the rest of any property too - if selling a place in need of renovation, just sell, don't mess about!\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: just to say, I'm not looking to fully renovate in an attempt to increase value. I've already decided I want to sell and get another place that doesn't need any / minimal work (a full renovation won't be worth my time/money). The question here is whether it's worth making relatively minor improvements to e.g. that flat roof, or not bother and just flip it as is?\n",
      "Comments:\n",

      "Description: The property was told to be chain free, we have started the process in July, we were ready to move, even our solicitor have asked for a prefreed completion date, \"preferably end of this week, beginning of next\". We gave ourdate, when the seller reacted with a \"we have just ordered the seaches on the property we agreed to buy\". The problem is, we have already told our current landlord that we are moving out soon and the new tenants deposited the flat where we currntly live, so we won't be able to hold down the fort for very long. The searches they have just ordered will take another 3-4 weeks, but we have no info if that one has any chain on it. We really do love the property, but the seller and the EA totally blindsided us. What can we do? Ask them to break the chain? (their property was on the market for over a year and they had to reduce the price to even get our offer in). Our mortgage offer will expire in January but we will likely vacate the flat we are living before that.\n",

I appreciate this is going to be a long rant so thanks in advance. Here's the situation: \\n\\n  \\nSo the EA put my house on the market with a guide price of £290,000 – £300,000. It's a 3 bed end terraced property which I bought for £215,000 in 2019. I have some spent in excess of £20,000 in TLC and modernisation etc. My house saw lots of interest and as per the EA, had a few offers between £285,000 – £290,000 but I did not want to sell for that price as it was merely meeting the guide price (though the EA tried to convince me to accept those offers numerous times as surely they'd like to do a quick sale). \\n\\nEventually, got an offer for £295,000 and we agreed a £297,000 figure. All well at stage as my offer for the property I wanted to buy was accepted based on the £297,000 figure (although I do have additional funds to cover the +/- 10% contingency). I only have around £75000 left on the mortgage so my LTV for the next property is quite good and have a mortgage offer @ 3.85% for 5 years with a 69% LTV. \\n\\n  \\nNow, here's the situation, before I accepted the offer, the EA told me that the buyer had a 15% deposit and loved our house hence they were quite happy to pay our agreed price. I was confirmed with the EA whether they'd put money on accounts to do searches etc and I was told it's all good, after which I paid for searches on the next property as well. Throughout the process, I've been told by the EA that the affordability is not an issue for the buyer as their in-house mortgage broker has carried out the financial checks etc.\\n\\nNow, the buyer had the bank valuation done for my property it was down valued to £285,000 and I'm now told by the EA that although the buyer still loves the house, they won't pay a penny more than the valuation as the bank won't lend them more than the valuation. I've told the EA that I'd be happy to meet in the middle as I don't want to loose our next house but then the EA told me that the buyer's solicitor hasn't received the proper instructions from the buyer yet and it's been more than 6 weeks since the sale agreed.\\n\\nThis leaves us in a tricky position and  I appreciate that you cannot force anyone to buy or sell their house but this is rather frustrating as we've been fed incorrect information from the EA. I told them put the house back on market and tell the buyer that if they can't meet in the middle by the end of the week (which is today) then the house will go back on the market. \\n\\nNow the question is, what would you do in this situation? Would you bite the bullet and accept the £285,000 offer in the interest of keeping the process going? Or would you put the house back on market and risk loosing the next property? Or if you another suggestion/advise then that'd be highly appreciated. \\n\\nN.B I am planning to speak to the other EA and in a couple of days time to update them on the situation and give them assurance that I still to buy the house etc.  \\n\\n  \\nThanks again! \", comments=[\"Goodspheed (upvotes: 77): Only thing I'd say is that it's extremely likely that this exact scenario is going to come up with your next buyer if you remarket the property.\", 'Creepy-Escape796 (upvotes: 29): In this situation I would accept the £285,000 offer given the scenario you described.

    "## Full Flow Summary:\n",

    "1. **Starting Point:** The process starts at the `\"llm\"` node, where the agent interacts with a language model (e.g., generating or responding to queries).\n",
    "2. **Conditional Transitions:** Based on the result of the `\"llm\"` action, the `router` function determines the next step—either using the `\"search\"` tool or proceeding to the `\"final_answer\"` node.\n",
    "3. **Feedback Loops:** If the `\"search\"` tool is used, the agent loops back to the `\"llm\"` node for further processing. This feedback loop allows the agent to iteratively refine its actions until it’s ready to provide a final answer.\n",
    "4. **Final State:** Once the agent transitions to the `\"final_answer\"` node, it provides its response, and the process ends at the `END` state, completing the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables the agent to dynamically handle a variety of tasks, using tools like search and language models, while allowing for iteration and refinement before delivering the final output."
